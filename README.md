## Usage

### Installation

**TODO: Review/update here.**

To properly reproduce the results using the code available in this repository, you need to install [Firedrake] (https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html).

After `firedrake` installation, activate its virtual env, go to the directory of this README file, and install the additional dependencies in the Firedrake env with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are able to run the code properly.

### Operating System

Please note that the codes and studies implemented in this repository were made on Ubuntu 22.04, which is the OS supported and recommended system to run the studies presented here.

If you are running on a different Linux-based OS, please check [Firedrake's installation instructions](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html#supported-systems).
